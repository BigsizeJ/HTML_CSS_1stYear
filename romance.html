    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p >Seventeen-year-old Rose hails from an aristocratic family and is set to be married. When she boards the Titanic, she meets Jack Dawson, an artist, and falls in love with him.</p>
    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>Beautifully scored, written and produced, the relevance of Titanic remains, 23 years later. Precisely crafted with stunningly accurate historical detail and unmissable cinematography, combined with actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's stunningly beautiful performance, where both actors were wonderfully suited to their roles.</p>
    <p>In this movie, you're watching a love story like no other, and it completely shattered my initial expectations. I was expecting it to be just another love story, but the moment I finished watching it, I was blown away.</p>
    <p>It was a Shakespearean-style tragedy combined with a refreshing love story, something which I never thought would come together so wonderfully in this film.</p>
    <p>It keeps you glued, and emotions are going to breakthrough in this one. Titanic is that movie that you either love or find it meh.</p>
