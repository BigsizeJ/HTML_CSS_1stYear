            <h2>Review</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Mad Max: Fury Road is a technical triumph. From brilliant cinematography to flawless editing, this movie has all what is required from an action blockbuster and more. The cinematographer of the film John Seale deserves a special applause for providing a wholesome variety of camera angle and movements in his shots which made the movie a visual delight. There is one specific shot where it looks like a sand dune but turns out to be Maxâ€™ head covered in sand. Such creative shots are what make this movie stand out as the viewers experience an awe factor while watching them unfold on screen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another praise-worthy element is the editing of the film done by Margaret Sixel who later went on to win an academy award for the same. Maintaining the continuity of such an action thriller is always a very tough task but the editing was almost flawless. The colour grading of the film is so appropriate and at time so overwhelming that one is almost transported to this fictional world while watching the film. Apart from this the reduced frame rate during majority of the movie made many sequences clumsy which is good in this case because the movie is all about displaying that how crazy and chaotic dystopian society could be. It adds to the viewing experience as the audiences can actually feel what the characters must be feeling. But for making the audiences relate to the characters so well, majority of the credit goes to the lead cast of the film.</p>
