            <h2>Review</h2>
            <br>
            <p>One of the best films of the entire century! A superbly crafted, MIND-BENDING, action packed, chilling thriller and suspense movie. I recommend it to every movie goofie and to the fans of Christopher Nolan. It is one of his best ( if not the best) movie which can keep you at the edge of your seat.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Inception surely requires multiple viewing to be understood completely but the more you understand the film, the more you fall in love with the concept and this film. Nolan surely thought about every aspect of the dream world and mastered the presentation of it on the big screen. Literally every thing the characters say about the dreams and the dream world in this movie are true. You can relate it to your real life experiences (about dreams of course).
