            <h2>Review</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Overall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual's, interesting story line and the movie will keep you interested till the end.The story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Christopher Nolan once said that 2001: A Space Odyssey was his all time favorite film and how he wanted to do a small tribute to he's next film. And then comes a movie called "Interstellar" that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie beautiful .The performances were brilliant,The directing by Christopher Nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he's films and I'm still shocked that he hasn't won an Oscar yet.My only nick pick with the movie is some of the character's in this movie wasn't all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character's that to me were interesting.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>This film shows a journey of four scientists who are in search of another planet other than the Earth itself ,as frequent dust storms seem to threathen the very existence of mankind.You need to be patient with this movie it is not just anot</p>
