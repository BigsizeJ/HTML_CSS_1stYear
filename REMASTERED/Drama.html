            <h2>Review</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Jaden Smith is adorable. He delivers an endearing performance as Gardner's son, Christopher, in what turns out to be a simple, sentimental, but ultimately inspiring movie. The film deals with a particular perspective, focusing, as the title implies, on the constitutional right to "pursue" happiness, rather than the right to be happy. In this manner, the movie can avoid focusing much on racism and how that factors into achieving the Dream. Instead, the relationship between father and son, through all the ups and downs of family and economic instability, take centre stage, with lovely results. “The Pursuit of Happyness” counts how Chris, compromises by some bad luck, a few stupid moves and a shrew for a wife, Linda, loses his apartment and, with his 5-year-old, Christopher, joins the ranks of the homeless, if not the hopeless. Evicted from the mainstream and bounced from shelter to shelter, Chris holds firm to his dignity, resolve, faith, love and independence. Money matters in “The Pursuit of Happyness,” as it does in life. But it matters more openly in this film than it does in most Hollywood stories that set their sights on the poor, largely because Chris’s pursuit of happiness eventually becomes interchangeable with his pursuit of money. He doesn’t want just a better, more secure life for himself and his child. The ending (I won’t give it away too much) had the tears flowing, tears of happiness of course. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves movies that have a real storyline and leave you with a good feeling. This movie is worth taking the time to see. Will Smith is an incredible actor and the real person whom this film was made around must be proud. This movie is gonna play with your emotions. You are gonna cry, laugh along with the characters.</p>
