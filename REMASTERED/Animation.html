            <h2>Review</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Inside out was an epic animated released on 17 of June 2015, this film is beautifully directed by Peter Doctor. This film is about a 11 years old girl named Riley Anderson (played by Kaitlyn Dias), Riley lives in Minnesota but one day she moves to a new county and her life changes from then on.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>This film had a creative plot, the plot is so well made that you would never get bored of it how ever much times you watch the it. When Reilly moved house because of her dad’s job, at this point the plot started to get more exciting and more unexpectedly more awesome. The reason why this part of the movie was my favourites is because I didn’t know what to expect especially when she was on the Brigid I didn’t know what her house would look like so I made me want t watch it even more. This movie has a must seen plot and if you miss even one bit you will regret it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The film had multiple good film techniques, the film techniques made the film look better then it would of been with out it. The film techniques that I found the best were the close up shot at the beginning of the movie and the zoom at the begging. The reason they used the close up and the zoom at the beginning was to tell us that Reilly was happy since Reilly was happy they add a zoom in and out to tell us that her first emotion was joy and that joy was in her head. The creators of this film (Pixar) did a really good job with the film techniques.</p>
