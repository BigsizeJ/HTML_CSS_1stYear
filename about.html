    <p>I'm Jessie V. Apac, Computer Science College student. i choose BSCS because ever since i was 15 i was intrigued in coding, programming and creating my own games. i like solving problems, especially in coding you have to solve something when there is wrong with your coding or programming.</p>
    <p>I liked technology in general, i don't choose Computer Field because its in demand i choose it because it is the one that interest me the most.</p>
    <p>I also like creating my own website using html with css. when i was 12 i remember i created website using weebly and talk to my friend about it. looking back even in my early days. i always interested in technology especially creating something that makes me proud of myself.</p>
